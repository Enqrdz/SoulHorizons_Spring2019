  - Greetings, Hunter! Welcome to the world of Soul Horizons!
  - This world is filled with beings aligned with the six elements of The Primordials
    our creators and caretakers.
  - 'You are a Soul Hunter. A warrior tasked with maintaining peace and balance between
    the elements and those who embody them. '
  - 'To do this you must call upon the elements to strike down your foes. '
  - This is where I come in. I will assist you in casting powerful spells of all kinds.
    These spells have different ranges, patterns, and effects.
  - Due to the nature of these powerful and wild magics, I am not able to accurately
    keep track of these spells.
  - The inscriptions will change positions on my pages, meaning that as you flip through
    me to cast spells you may find them to be in a different order.
  - The spells written in my pages can be adjusted at your discretion, and in your
    travels you may even come across new spells that I am able to inscribe.
  - Luckily for us your basic training should allow you to cast simple spells without
    my help. These spells are called Mantras, and are available for you to use at
    any time during battle.
  - Anyways, I am sure you are quite eager to get on with your travels?
  - Let's Go
